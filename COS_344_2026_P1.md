2  Overview

<a name="_page2_x42.52_y652.08"></a>For this practical, you will be implementing matrices, vectors, and shapes in C++. This will be used to programmatically understand fundamental linear algebra concepts needed for computer graphics, as<a name="_page2_x42.52_y752.28"></a> well as a basic understanding of how to use them.

3  Your Task:

You are required to implement all of the provided functions in the file..h Section 3.1[ explains](#_page3_x42.52_y129.50) the object management functions and Section 3[.2 e](#_page5_x42.52_y224.14)xplains all the linear algebra functions. Section 3.4 describes the provided functions that will be overwritten.

1. Object<a name="_page3_x42.52_y129.50"></a> management functions

This section describes the miscellaneous functions that need to be implemented.

1. Vector

<a name="_page3_x42.52_y193.97"></a>This class represents a vector [^1][ ](#_page3_x60.45_y775.46)in a possible N-D space. The size of the vector is specified as an integer template argument.

- Vector()
- This constructor should initialise the array using the template argument.
- It is at your discretion with what value the elements in the vector should be initialised to.
- It can be assumed that valid template arguments will be used.
- Vector(std::initializer\_list<float>)
- This constructor should initialise the array using the template argument.
- The array should be populated using the [initialiser list.](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/list_initialization.html)
- If the initialiser list contains more elements than the array can contain, take the first n value.
- If the initialiser list contains fewer elements than the array can contain, populate the remaining open spaces in the array with a value of your discretion.
- Hint: The following page may be useful,[ https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/std-](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/std-initializer_list-in-cpp-11/)initializer\_ [list-in-cpp-11/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/std-initializer_list-in-cpp-11/)
- Vector(float\*)
- This constructor should initialise the array using the template argument, and the passed-in parameter.
- Make use of shallow copies for the array.
- It can be assumed that the input to this constructor will be valid.
- Vector(const Matrix<n, 1>&)
  - This constructor should create a vector from the passed-in matrix.
- ∼Vector()
  - This destructor should deallocate any dynamically allocated memory.
- Vector(const Vector<n>&)
  - This copy constructor should create a deep copy of the passed-in parameter.
- operator Matrix<n,1>() const;
  - This is a conversion operator [^2][ ](#_page4_x60.45_y726.55)which will return an N × 1 Matrix, populated with the values in the vector.
- Vector<n>& operator=(const Vector<n>&)
- This is an assignment operator [^3][ ](#_page4_x60.45_y750.46)and should follow all the conventions of an assignment operator as was taught in COS110.
- int getN() const
- Getter for the size of the vector.
2. Matrix

<a name="_page4_x42.52_y323.41"></a>This class represents a row-major [^4][ ](#_page4_x60.45_y774.37)2-D matrix of size N ×M. The dimensions of the vector is passed as integer template arguments, where the first parameter represents andN the second .M

- Matrix()
  - The constructor should initialise the array such that it forms a N × matrix,M populated with values of your choice.
  - It can be assumed that valid template arguments will be used.
- Matrix(float\*\*)
  - The constructor should initialise the array such that it forms a N × matrix,M populated with values contained in the passed-in parameter.
  - It can be assumed that the parameters will be valid.
  - Use shallow copy to initialize the array member variable.
- Matrix(const Matrix<n,m> &)
  - This copy constructor should be used to create a deep copy of the passed-in parameter.
- virtual ∼Matrix()
- This virtual destructor should deallocate any dynamically allocated memory.
- int getN() const
  - Getter for the N template variable.
- int getM() const
  - Getter for the M template variable.
- Matrix<n,m>& operator=(const Matrix<n,m>&)
- This is an assignment operator [^5][ ](#_page5_x60.45_y751.55)and should follow all the conventions of an assignment operator as was taught in COS110.
2. Linear<a name="_page5_x42.52_y224.14"></a> algebra functions

This section describes the linear algebra functions you will be implementing. Assume the following matrices, vectors, and scalars [^6][ ](#_page5_x60.45_y775.46)have been defined:

Matrices: A ∈ Rn×m and B ∈ R m×r

Vectors: v,w,t ∈ R n

Scalars: s ∈ R

Your task will be to implement the functions as described in Table 1.

Take note of the following:

1. For the unit vector function, if the magnitude of the vector is 0, then throw:

"Invalid␣unit␣vector" 1![](Aspose.Words.b5ed044e-c0c2-4a1d-81f0-ba96ec77019b.002.png)

2. For the cross product function, the cross product function has been specialised to only work on vector’s of size 3.
2. For the magnitude of the vector, use the Euclidean norm [^7][ ](#_page5_x60.45_y787.41)for your calculations.
2. For the matrix multiplication function, your template preamble will need to look as follows:

template <int n, int m> 1 ![](Aspose.Words.b5ed044e-c0c2-4a1d-81f0-ba96ec77019b.003.png)template <int a> 2

5. If the determinant of a matrix cannot be calculated, throw the following error: "Matrix␣is␣not␣square" 1![](Aspose.Words.b5ed044e-c0c2-4a1d-81f0-ba96ec77019b.004.png)
5. Hint: Create a global submatrix function that creates a smaller matrix using the original matrix.

3. Shapes

<a name="_page7_x42.52_y42.52"></a>The shapes hierarchy is required to demonstrate how the above matrix and vector classes can be used to create and manipulate shapes.

1. Shape<a name="_page7_x42.52_y104.00"></a> class

The shape class has the following pure virtual functions:

- operator\*=
  - This function takes in a matrix and performs matrix multiplication on each of the vectors that make up the shape.
  - This function should return the modified this object.
- operator\*
  - This function takes in a matrix and performs matrix multiplication on each of the vectors that make up the shape.
  - Note the function should apply the matrix to a copy of the this object, and return this copy.
- getPoints
- This function will return an array containing a linearised version of the shape, where each component of each shape of the vectors comprising the shape is added to the array.
- getNumPoints
- This function returns the number of elements in the array that is produced by the getPoints function.

Note: You will notice some functions in the derived classes have been omitted. Use the function description as given above to implement the functions in the derived classes.

2. Triangle<a name="_page7_x42.52_y568.68"></a> class

The Triangle class represents a triangle shape and publicly inherits from the Shape class. It can be assumed that the ,n which indicates the dimensionality that the triangle exists in, has the property n >= 2.

1. Members

<a name="_page7_x42.52_y662.83"></a>The Triangle class has three Vector<n> members, which represent the three points that make up the<a name="_page7_x42.52_y743.06"></a> triangle.

2. Functions

The Triangle class has the following functions:

- Triangle(const Vector<n>& p1, const Vector<n>& p2, const Vector<n>& p3)
- This is the constructor and should initialise the points with the parameters, in the same order as they were declared (i.e., parameter p1 is used to initialise member variable ,p1 and so on).
- Triangle(const Triangle<n>&)
  - This is a copy constructor and should make a deep copy of the passed-in parameter.
- getPoints
- Expanding on the description in the Shape class, this function will first populate the array with the components of p1, p2, and lastly p3.
3. Square<a name="_page8_x42.52_y314.46"></a> class

The Square class represents a triangle shape and publicly inherits from the Shape class. It can be assumed that the ,n which indicates the dimensionality that the square exists in, has the property n >= 2.

1. Members

<a name="_page8_x42.52_y398.31"></a>The Square class has four Vector<n> members, which represent the four points that make up the square. The members are:

- tl = Top Left
- tr = Top Right
- br = Bottom Right
- bl = Bottom Left
2. Functions

<a name="_page8_x42.52_y597.74"></a>The Square class has the following functions:

- Square(const Vector<n>& centre, float height, float width)
- This constructor must calculate the position of each member variable, and initialise them accordingly.
- It can be assumed that the centre parameter is in the centre of the square.
- Consult Figure [1 to](#_page9_x423.79_y254.00) aid your calculations.

Figure 1: Example figure of the square for the Square constructor

- Apart from the first and second components, all of the member variables<a name="_page9_x423.79_y254.00"></a> should have the same values for the remaining component as the centre parameter. In other words, if the centre parameter has the value of 5 for the third component, all of the member variables should have the value of 5 for the third component.
- Square(const Vector<n>& tl, const Vector<n>& tr, const Vector<n>& br, const Vector<n>& bl)
- This constructor should initialise the appropriate member variable with the appropriate parameter.
- Square(const Square<n>&)
  - This is a copy constructor and should make a deep copy of the passed-in parameter.
- getPoints
- Expanding on the description in the Shape class, this function will first populate the array with the components of tl, ,tr ,br and lastly .bl
4. Provided<a name="_page9_x42.52_y613.25"></a> functions

You are provided with the following functions in the files.h Do not change these functions as they will be overwritten on FitchFork.

1. Vector
- <a name="_page9_x42.52_y683.57"></a>Subscript operator
  - This can be used to access and set elements in the vector.
- Print function
- This function is used by the marking script to print out the vector.
2. Matrix
- <a name="_page10_x42.52_y68.81"></a>Subscript operator
  - This can be used to access and set elements in the vector.
- Print function
- This function is used by the marking script to print out the vector.
3. Triangle
- <a name="_page10_x42.52_y211.95"></a>Print function
- This function prints out the coordinates for each of the points in the triangle, using Vector’s print function.
4. Square
- <a name="_page10_x42.52_y317.71"></a>Print function
- This function prints out the coordinates for each of the points in the triangle, using Vector’s print function.
4  Implementation<a name="_page10_x42.52_y423.47"></a> Details
- You must implement the functions in the header files exactly as stipulated in this specification. Failure to do so will result in compilation errors on FitchFork.
- You may only use C++11.
- You may only utilize the specified libraries. Failure to do so will result in compilation errors on FitchFork.
- Do not include using namespace std in any of the files.
- You may only use the following libraries:
- IOStream
- CMath
- iomanip
- initializer\_list
- You will notice that each submission uses randomly generated matrices, vectors, triangles and squares. This is to allow you to view your output on FitchFork and see where your code failed.
- Ensure you do not have any debugging output, as this can interfere with the marking script.
- The exceptions will not be explicitly tested. They are there to assist you while testing your own code such that you are able to find errors easier.
- When adding helper functions, add them as global functions in the cpp files. This implies you will need to use the public interface to access member variables of objects. It is highly recommended that you make use of global helper functions.
5  Template<a name="_page11_x42.52_y151.42"></a> Programming Error

Due to the use of template arguments to dictate the sizes of the vectors and matrices, you are effectively getting the compiler to create different classes for different size vectors and matrices. This is a simple example of template programming. The use of template programming can greatly speed up your program and ensure that you use the correct sizes for different functions.

While coding your assignment, you may encounter the following error:

fatal error: template instantiation depth exceeds maximum of 900 (use 1![](Aspose.Words.b5ed044e-c0c2-4a1d-81f0-ba96ec77019b.009.png)

’-ftemplate -depth=’ to increase the maximum)

This happens due to your program exceeding the compiler’s recursive depth limit. To illustrate this, an example is provided below:

#include <iostream > 1 2![](Aspose.Words.b5ed044e-c0c2-4a1d-81f0-ba96ec77019b.010.png)

using namespace std; 3

4 template <int n> 5 class Counter{ 6

public: 7 Counter <n-1> countDown(); 8

9 }; 10

11 template <int n> 12 Counter <n-1> Counter <n>::countDown() 13 { 14 cout << n << endl; 15 Counter <n-1> next; 16 next.countDown(); 17 return next; 18

} 19 20

int main(){ 21 Counter <10> counter; 22 counter.countDown(); 23

} 24

As can be seen in this code example, a Counter class is created for n = ,10 which needs to create a Counter class for n = ,9 which in turn needs to make a Counter class n .= This8 is repeated all the way to n = −889, where the compile recursive depth limit was reached. To avoid this, a recursive base case is needed. The easiest way to do this is to specialise the Counter class for the base case, which is n = 0. This can be done as follows:

#include <iostream > 1 2![](Aspose.Words.b5ed044e-c0c2-4a1d-81f0-ba96ec77019b.011.png)

using namespace std; 3

4 template <int n> 5 class Counter{ 6

public: 7 Counter <n-1> countDown(); 8

9 }; 10

11 template <int n> 12 Counter <n-1> Counter <n>::countDown() 13 { 14 cout << n << endl; 15 Counter <n-1> next; 16 next.countDown(); 17 return next; 18

} 19 20

template <> 21 Counter <-1> Counter <0>::countDown(){ 22 cout << "0␣-␣blast-off" << endl; 23 Counter <-1> next; 24 return next; 25

} 26 27

int main(){ 28 Counter <10> counter; 29 counter.countDown(); 30

} 31

The code will now correctly compile and all the Counter classes will be created at compile time and available for immediate use at run time. Note that this is a trivial example of the power of compile-time programming, and more details on this subject are left for [COS782.](COS782)

Hint: you may find this handy when you are creating matrices of size n − 1.
